# housing-price-regression

This is my second data product for my university course.  
It's aim is to predict housing prices using regression.  

To run it, simply clone this repo and open the .Rmd file. This requires a working R environment.  
If you don't want to run it, a version of the notebook with the outputs is available in the .html file.  

Please note that this project wasn't version controlled, due to it's notebook format. It's only uploaded here for showcasing purposes.
